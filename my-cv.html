<h2>Personal statement </h2>
<p>Until early 2018 I worked as an Assistant Manager (2IC) at a telecommunications store. I have 4 + years with Oracle-based CRM systems (Siebel) GUIs. I am now looking to branch out into a more hands-on technical career with real-life applications and the ability to turn that knowledge into innovative, interesting, and unique products. I completed a Level 6 Diploma in software development in 2020 and have crossed credits over to AUT to gain my level 7 BCIS Software Development degree. A passion for working with people, pride in giving the best service and experience I possibly can, patience, a readiness for a challenge, and an exhibition of good ethical judgment in all aspects of work are what I strive for. I am currently doing contract work part-time as a Brand Ambassador for Brand Spanking. I would like a more exciting and collaborative work environment. and due to current circumstances, I believe it's time to get hands-on experience in the field.

Personal interests and activities
 </h2>
 <p>
I tend to enjoy spending my weekends at home, visiting family in Waikato, or learning new VFX film techniques. I have taken an interest in DIY gadgets, 3d printing, and cosplay. I am always looking to expand my knowledge if it's not flashing custom ROMs on an old android device, it's following js tutorials or just a nice walk in the Clevedon ranges.
