This Site will serve as a portfolio of my front end design ability , and is aimed to document my understanding of coding and the coding process. 
my aim is to code whenever i can in order to display my passion for coding and all things design and technology, 
but also to showcase contemporary uses of the tools and techniques I have learned throughout my time programming.
