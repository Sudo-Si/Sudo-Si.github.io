             This has been an interesting project!... when I started the project I forgot to add the vh to the wrappper 
             eleent wich allowed for no scolling , this was not ideal because i thougt i had done everything 
             correctly and it was not scrolling, what i did was try again and use the png files provided in the tut repo, and they worked.... 
             hmmm what is going on? was it my pictures? I re-added the picture files to the already working paths and this seemed to work, 
             however i was getting a weird white block when scrolling only in full screen, the smaller screen does not seem to show it ? 
             looking at the dev tools in the browser nothing came up, was it something in my photos? because the other pictures arenet doing this, 
             i tried changing the format to svg and there are no problems, but sizing and scle need to be adjusted as those values dont auto adjust from png to svg
